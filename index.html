    This is a JavaScript implementation of the simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron">Perceptron</a>
    algorithm.<br />
    A perceptron is a binary classifier that works through a linear operation on its input. The algorithm updates the
    weights used in the operation so that the classification provide better results.<br />
    In this example, our Perceptron has to classify 2-D points on a graph. The class of a given point corresponds to
    which side of a line (represented on the graph as a <span style="font-weight: 700">bold</span> line) the point
    is on; visually, this is shown as the color of the points. As the algorithm goes, the Perceptron (represented by
    the thinner line) will update itself and progressively match the reference class; which is shown on the graph as
    the thinner line getting closer to the bolder line.
